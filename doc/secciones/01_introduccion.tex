\chapter{Introducción}

En este capítulo se describen la motivación del proyecto y los objetivos que
se quieren alcanzar durante el desarrollo, así como una introducción histórica al
a la aplicación del análisis al fútbol. 

\section{Motivación}

Los deportes de equipo, especialmente el fútbol, han sido analizados 
repetidamente desde el punto de vista de las redes complejas, buscando 
correlación entre meso y macroestructuras reticulares y el desempeño del 
equipo. Sin embargo, no se ha hecho ningún análisis con redes causales, 
buscando relaciones causa-efecto en las redes de pases y, una vez más, 
su influencia en el desempeño del equipo o su capacidad para encontrar 
descriptores macro del equipo a lo largo de una competición determinada, 
dependiendo o no del rival que haya enfrente.

WIP --
Así pues, el análisis del fútbol no es para nada algo nuevo, y no es otra cosa que 
pensar, observar y reflexionar sobre lo que ocurre a lo largo de partidos 
o temporadas, para actuar consecuentemente y, por ejemplo, fichar a 
ciertos jugadores en detrimento de otros, centrarse más en la defensa 
que en el ataque, entrenar un tipo de jugada o pases específicos, darle 
importancia a la táctica o a la condición física. La lista puede ser muy 
larga, tanto como los factores que, literalmente, entran en juego.

Llevándolo entonces un poco a tierra y como motivación principal del presente trabajo,

\section{Objetivos del trabajo} \label{sect:goals}

Dado el problema anterior, los objetivos a resolver son:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{obj:1} Crear una herramienta para que personas del equipo técnico de
    un equipo de fútbol, como analistas de datos, analistas técnicos, analistas de rendimiento 
    físico o entrenadores, puedan tomar decisiones en base al estudio que se haga antes, durante 
    o después de un partido. 
    \item \label{obj:2} Aplicar redes bayesianas al análisis de partidos de fútbol.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Historia de la analítica en el fútbol}

Not much is known about the use of statistics in soccer before 1996. Older 
fans know that Arsene Wenger used a computer program during his time 
managing Monaco in the late 1980s. In any case, at this time clubs still 
relied heavily on their own data collection and storage methods.

In 1996, Opta began collecting match data for the English Premier League. 
This included all of the stats that a casual soccer fan is used to – number 
of passes, number of tackles, distance travelled, etc. In many ways Opta’s 
collection of this data was the starting point of what we now refer to as 
soccer analytics.

The use of stats was also headlined in 1999 when Bolton hired “Big Sam” Allardyce 
as their new manager. Legend has it Big Sam realized he couldn’t match 
the payrolls of bigger clubs and instead decided to hire a team of 
statisticians. They observed that the ball changed hands about 400 
times in a single game, and that once a team lost the ball, quickly 
getting back into a solid defensive position was one of the best ways 
to avoid conceding goals. In addition, it is rumoured that Big Sam’s 
(often-criticized) direct approach is a result of the observation that 
about 30\% of goals come from set pieces. By focusing more on set pieces, 
he was able to have Bolton score about 50\% of their goals this way.

In 2003 Michael Lewis released Moneyball and its influence quickly spread 
across the Atlantic. The book’s release naturally started raising questions 
about the use of data in soccer. A couple of transfer market irrationalities 
were quickly exposed, most notably the salary/career length ratio for keepers 
and strikers and a strange bias towards recruiting taller players.

Fuelled by stats like Opta’s and the ideas of efficiency from baseball, 
analytics work from roughly 2003 until now has exposed many limitations 
in the popular stats. At the team level, a surprisingly low correlation 
was found between win percentage and metrics like the number of shots, 
possession, or number of passes. To this day, shot totals are used as 
some kind of proof that Team A played better than Team B. This however 
does little to explain the efficient tactics of clubs like Atletico Madrid, 
which take pride in limiting their opponents to a barrage of hopeful shots 
from outside the box while Atletico themselves focus on creating a handful 
of very good chances in the danger zone. At the player level, stats such as 
the number of tackles or distance travelled also didn’t seem to be very 
indicative of player quality. Nonetheless most of these are still used 
today in both TV broadcasts and journalistic work.


\section{Football Analytics in a nutshell}

Contextual data: main events like goals, replacement, yellow cards, etc… 
It’s characterized by the minute of the event, so quite basic. Still useful 
for news and betting companies for live broadcasts on the web.

Event data: much detailed, they track every ball action: passes, tackles, 
crosses, dribbles, shoots, etc… They are characterized by coordinates data 
(sometimes in three dimensions), so very useful for any person looking to 
analyze and create models of the game. Used by football clubs, betting 
companies, and sometimes newsrooms. Gathered by hand and algorithms.

Tracking data: every player's position and ball position at really low 
framerates sometimes 15 frames by seconds. Less mature but used by big 
clubs and researchers. Gathered either by physical sensors or software 
algorithms.

It’s often too complex and too expensive for clubs, betting companies, 
and newsrooms to gather data by themself. So a landscape of providers 
emerged too, with diverse offers, diverse data :

Stats Perform (ex Opta): the big one. It’s one of the first which started 
to gather football data at scale. They have a range of clients from top 
football clubs to big newsrooms. They are well known for both contextual 
and event data.

Statsbomb: the serious challenger. They provide detailed event data feeds 
and great analytics resources.

Skillcorner/Second Spectrum/Metrica: focused on tracking data and analysis. 
They use state-of-the-art algorithms or sensors to track all the data they 
can. The utilization of these data is infinite but complex.


The best reason to try to measure the sport is the same reason people 
used to say it couldn’t be measured: soccer is hard. Even coaches and 
analysts and scouts who’ve spent their lives learning to watch it won’t 
see games quite the same way. There are too many moving parts, too many 
possibilities to hold in your head at once. Had we but world enough and 
time, you might rewatch each match over and over to pause and study it 
and it’d still be impossible to see and remember it all. And if you have 
to do that for an opponent’s entire season, or a continent you’re charged 
with scouting? Pretty soon it starts to look like the nerds might be onto 
something.

Data scales. It doesn’t sleep or steal your food out of the office fridge. 
It’s objective-ish and consistent-ish, depending on what exactly it measures 
and how, and honestly sometimes even sketchy data is better than the stories 
we reduce soccer to without it. The hard part of analytics comes when 
we have to boil down the data to stories, too, to make it useful. How do 
we know what it means—and what we’re missing?

Where do soccer analytics come from?
The story of soccer analytics usually starts with a cautionary tale. At 3:50 
p.m. on March 18, 1950—his notes were very precise—a retired Royal Air Force 
officer named Charles Reep, who had trained as an accountant, began 
systematically recording events at a Swindon Town match. Reep didn’t just 
want a detailed record of what happened. Like any good analyst, he wanted 
to know why it happened and what teams could learn from the data to 
improve their play. His pet finding over his decades of logging matches 
was that most goals resulted from possessions of three passes or fewer, 
which he took to mean that teams should simplify their tactics to get 
to goal faster, with less of the namby-pamby possession stuff. In an 
era when Hungary’s “pattern-weaving” passing style was the toast of 
the world game, Reep was writing articles with headlines like This 
Pattern-Weaving Talk is All Bunk!

The problem wasn’t Reep’s diligent data collection—it was his analysis. Most 
possessions are short, especially if you define them strictly enough to 
ensure that result; if there are a lot more short sequences, it’s no 
surprise that more goals result from them. A less polemical analyst 
might have inquired about the rate of goalscoring on possessions of various 
lengths, or how exactly those three-pass possessions developed. Reep’s own 
work showed that “60 per cent of all goalscoring moves begin 35 yards from 
an opponent’s goal,” which might make you wonder whether pattern-weaving was 
perhaps a good way to get close to goal in the first place. Not Reep, who 
worked with the great Wolves manager Stan Cullis to implement a style based 
on the “wholly English” principles of “direct passing.” Wolverhampton’s 
success in the fifties, including a dramatic upset of the Hungarian 
champions Honved, was seen as proof of concept and an affirmation of the 
long ball game. By his own account, Reep gathered data to “provide a 
counter to reliance upon memory, tradition and personal impressions 
that led to speculation and soccer ideologies.” But the result was 
more ideology, now with the false certainty of science.

Contrary to what you’ll sometimes read, Reep wasn’t the first pioneer of 
soccer analytics. His own interest had been piqued by an account of Herbert 
Chapman’s statistical approach to coaching Arsenal in the early thirties. 
Just this year, the internet turned up some stunningly modern-looking 
data vizzes drawn by hand for individual matches in 1920s Hungary, Reep’s 
bête noire. A Budapest grad student named Attila Bátorfy discovered that 
dozens of the charts had run on the front page of a daily newspaper dating 
back to 1922, and were popular enough to be imitated by sports dailies in 
Italy and Sweden.

These days soccer data collection is big business. Companies like Opta and 
Statsbomb use human coders and computer vision to log information about 
every event that happens on the ball: passes, dribbles, shots, headers, 
fouls, tackles, interceptions, blocks, clearances, claims, and saves. 
Analysts can count these raw events, divvy them up or plot them out, 
derive second-order metrics like possession percentages, or use them 
to build sophisticated models. There’s a growing emphasis on linking 
data to video, which is undergoing a revolution of its own thanks to 
global providers like Wyscout. The juiciest stuff on the market is 
tracking data, which uses cameras or other tech to trace every 
player’s movements so that analysts can see off-ball patterns 
and soccer’s most prized commodity, space. You can join tracking 
data to event data for a more complete picture of what’s happening, 
but even that won’t tell you which way players are looking or how 
their bodies are arranged, so some researchers go even further and 
collect gaze and pose data. Because tracking data is expensive to 
collect and impossible to come by for, say, youth prospects in the 
Bolivian second division, analysts sometimes try to extract insights 
from it and apply them back to event data, which you can buy for just 
about any league with a TV contract or even a decent camera in the 
stands following the ball. But even when you’ve got information on 
what happened in a game, Reep’s story serves as a reminder that 
the challenge is what you do with it.

What is analytics good for?
Contribution
Style
Skill
Potential
Big questions

Contribution is the most straightforward, since it’s about measuring who 
did what (although when you try to put a value on those contributions 
things get more complicated). 

Style separates what happened from how and why.

Skill, at the player level, tries to give a more nuanced—and 
speculative—picture of contribution by accounting for circumstances 
like role, tactics, and team strength. 

Potential strays even further from what we know into what we wish we 
knew, trying to project how a team or player or even a particular 
pattern of play would fare under circumstances different from in the 
past, like how a young player might grow if he transferred to a team 
with an unfamiliar playstyle in a tougher league. And then there’s 
a catchall for research questions that sprawl across or outside 
the other categories. This might include evaluations of a game 
model or of specific tactics.

You can do all of this without data—they’re really just kinds 
of questions you can ask about soccer, not inherently quantitative 
problems—and a lot of coaches and sporting directors would rather 
trust analysts’ eyes than whatever some computer spits out. But 
the supposed dichotomy between data and video, or data and scouting, 
or data and knowing anything at all about the game, is transparently 
phony. Good analytics are always informed by what the nerds call 
“domain knowledge”—the expertise of players and staff. If you do it 
right, you might even get some benefits flowing the other direction, too. 
The best analytics work makes us better at seeing and thinking about the game.

If you’ve heard of sports analytics, you’ve probably also heard of Moneyball, 
Michael Lewis’s book about how the Oakland A’s front office turned a 
low-budget baseball team into a powerhouse by using stats to recruit 
players with undervalued skillsets. The story hooked not only fans 
but also business travelers killing time in the airport bookshop 
during an era when an explosion of data had everyone scrambling to 
extract valuable analytical insights from it.

Not long after Moneyball was published in 2003, Beane was already turning 
his attention to soccer, starting with Oakland’s neighboring San Jose 
Earthquakes. But applying analytics to soccer, as people with a penchant 
for the obvious never get tired of pointing out, is harder than in baseball. 
There’s more you can potentially do with data in a fluid sport than scout 
high-OBP catchers or plot an infield shift, but faced with the challenges 
of getting there, as well as the equally daunting job of convincing 
decisionmakers that what you’ve found is useful and not another 
Reepian mistake, not many organizations have been in a hurry to go all in.

Most clubs do at least some data scouting. The generally accepted best 
practice is you use stats to pull together a list of some good prospects 
who fit the profile you’re looking for, doing a much wider and faster 
first pass than a scouting network could; then you watch a bunch of video 
to get a more complete picture of the players and narrow things down; 
and finally you might send out a scout to get to know your favorite 
guys in their environments and maybe watch a few live games just for 
kicks. Done right, this can make the recruiting process more efficient 
and with any luck find you better players for cheaper than the old 
system of binoculars in the stands and agents hawking their guys 
on the phone. 

While recruiting probably offers the biggest bang for your 
statistical buck—ask Liverpool, whose elite analytics operation 
helped them build a squad that became champions of everything on 
a comparatively reasonable budget—it’s not the only thing data 
is good for. A lot of clubs also use analytics as part of their 
opposition scouting. Again, not hard to see why. When Marcelo 
Bielsa got caught spying on Derby County and responded in the 
most Bielsa way possible by convening a press conference to 
lecture reporters on every detail of his weekly game prep, 
the biggest takeaway from his mountains of binders and endless 
slides was that his staff was sacrificing sleep to compile 
information that could have been done at the push of a button. 
Analyzing a soccer team is hard, and there are definitely parts 
that are better done with video, but a lot of clubs integrate 
their data and video operations to make each other’s lives easier. 
If nothing else, analytics can be the quickest way of pulling up 
the right clips for analysts to study.

And then there are what you might call the big questions. Billy Beane’s 
staff was focused on buying cheap wins, but they took their inspiration 
from Bill James, an idealistic fan prone to writing things like, 
“I do not start with the numbers any more than a mechanic starts with 
a monkey wrench. I start with the game, with the things that I see 
there and the things that people say there. And I ask: Is it true? 
Can you validate it? Can you measure it? How does it fit with the 
rest of the machinery?”

The best possible use of analytics isn’t just to measure the game 
but to understand it. That’s what smart clubs do when they use data 
to ask questions about how they play, or better yet how they should 
play. It’s what academic researchers and curious fans do with whatever 
data they can get their hands on. It’s what Charles Reep and Herbert 
Chapman and those Hungarian newspaper readers were after, even if it 
didn’t always work out. When space space space covers analytics, 
we’ll be asking the same questions James wanted to know—is it true? 
can you measure it? how does it all fit together?—but about soccer’s 
more intricate, more beautiful, and altogether extraordinary machine.
