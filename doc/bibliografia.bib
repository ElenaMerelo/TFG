abstract="When a Bayesian network is defined over a very large or complicated domain, computing the posterior probabilities given some evidence may become unfeasible. In fact, probability propagation is known to be an NP-hard problem. Since it is common to find huge domains in practical applications, approximate algorithms have been developed. These algorithms compute estimations of the posterior probabilities with lower requirements, in terms of memory and computing time, than exact algorithms. In this paper we present some of the most recent developments in the area of approximate propagation algorithms.",

ABSTRACT = {Non-extensive statistical mechanics appears as a powerful way to describe complex systems. Tsallis entropy, the main core of this theory has been remained as an unproven assumption. Many people have tried to derive the Tsallis entropy axiomatically. Here we follow the work of Wang (EPJB, 2002) and use the incomplete information theory to retrieve the Tsallis entropy. We change the incomplete information axioms to consider the escort probability and obtain a correct form of Tsallis entropy in comparison with Wang’s work.},
