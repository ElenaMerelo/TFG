abstract="When a {B}ayesian network is defined over a very large or complicated domain, computing the posterior probabilities given some evidence may become unfeasible. In fact, probability propagation is known to be an NP-hard problem. Since it is common to find huge domains in practical applications, approximate algorithms have been developed. These algorithms compute estimations of the posterior probabilities with lower requirements, in terms of memory and computing time, than exact algorithms. In this paper we present some of the most recent developments in the area of approximate propagation algorithms.",

ABSTRACT = {Non-extensive statistical mechanics appears as a powerful way to describe complex systems. Tsallis entropy, the main core of this theory has been remained as an unproven assumption. Many people have tried to derive the Tsallis entropy axiomatically. Here we follow the work of Wang (EPJB, 2002) and use the incomplete information theory to retrieve the Tsallis entropy. We change the incomplete information axioms to consider the escort probability and obtain a correct form of Tsallis entropy in comparison with Wang’s work.},

abstract = {This work presents a methodology for analysing the interactions between players in a football team, from the point of view of graph theory and complex networks. We model the complex network of passing interactions between players of a same team in 32 official matches of the Liga de Fútbol Profesional (Spain), using a passing/reception graph. This methodology allows us to understand the play structure of the team, by analysing the offensive phases of game-play. We utilise two different strategies for characterising the contribution of the players to the team: the clustering coefficient, and centrality metrics (closeness and betweenness). We show the application of this methodology by analyzing the performance of a professional Spanish team according to these metrics and the distribution of passing/reception in the field. Keeping in mind the dynamic nature of collective sports, in the future we will incorporate metrics which allows us to analyse the performance of the team also according to the circumstances of game-play and to different contextual variables such as, the utilisation of the field space, the time, and the ball, according to specific tactical situations.}

abstract = {Bayesian belief networks provide a natural, efficient method for representing probabilistic dependencies among a set of variables. For these reasons, numerous researchers are exploring the use of belief networks as a knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. Algorithms have been developed previously for efficient probabilistic inference using special classes of belief networks. More general classes of belief networks, however, have eluded efforts to develop efficient inference algorithms. We show that probabilistic inference using belief networks is NP-hard. Therefore, it seems unlikely that an exact algorithm can be developed to perform probabilistic inference efficiently over all classes of belief networks. This result suggests that research should be directed away from the search for a general, efficient probabilistic inference algorithm, and toward the design of efficient special-case, average-case, and approximation algorithms.}

abstract = {It is known that exact computation of conditional probabilities in belief networks is NP-hard. Many investigators in the AI community have tacitly assumed that algorithms for performing approximate inference with belief networks are of polynomial complexity. Indeed, special cases of approximate inference can be performed in time polynomial in the input size. However, we have discovered that the general problem of approximating conditional probabilities with belief networks, like exact inference, resides in the NP-hard complexity class. We develop a complexity analysis to elucidate the difficulty of approximate probabilistic inference. More specifically, we show that the existence of a polynomial-time relative approximation algorithm for major classes of problem instances implies that NP ⊆ P. We present our proof and explore the implications of the result.}

abstract = {SUMMARY A causal network is used in a number of areas as a depiction of patterns of ‘influence’ among sets of variables. In expert systems it is common to perform ‘inference’ by means of local computations on such large but sparse networks. In general, non-probabilistic methods are used to handle uncertainty when propagating the effects of evidence, and it has appeared that exact probabilistic methods are not computationally feasible. Motivated by an application in electromyography, we counter this claim by exploiting a range of local representations for the joint probability distribution, combined with topological changes to the original network termed ‘marrying’ and ‘filling-in‘. The resulting structure allows efficient algorithms for transfer between representations, providing rapid absorption and propagation of evidence. The scheme is first illustrated on a small, fictitious but challenging example, and the underlying theory and computational aspects are then discussed.},

The scoring metric computes a score reflecting the goodness-of-fit of the structure to the data. The search procedure tries to identify network structures with high scores. Heckerman et al. (1995) introduce a Bayesian metric, called the BDe metric, that computes the relative posterior probability of a network structure given data. In this paper, we show that the search problem of identifying a Bayesian network---among those where each node has at most K parents---that has a relative posterior probability greater than a given constant is NP-complete, when the BDe metric is used.",

abstract = {Background
Home advantage (HA) is well documented in a wide range of team sports including association football (soccer). Although much attention has been paid to differences in the overall magnitude of HA between football competitions and across time, few studies have investigated HA at the team level.
Methods
A novel method of estimating HA for individual teams, based solely on home performance, was used to compare HA between the highest performing teams and countries in the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League over a 10-year period (2003/2004 to 2012/2013). Away disadvantage (AD) was also estimated based on each team's performance away from home. Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate covariate adjusted HA and AD in terms of the percentage of goals scored at home (HA) and conceded away from home (AD).
Results
When controlling for differences in team ability, HA did not vary significantly between the 13 selected teams. There was evidence (p < 0.1), however, of between-team variation in AD, ranging from 45% (away advantage) to 68% (away disadvantage). When teams were grouped into the 11 selected countries, both HA and AD varied significantly (p < 0.02) between countries: HA ranged from 52% for Turkish teams to 70% for English teams, while AD ranged from 52% (France) to 67% (Turkey).
Conclusion
Differences in style of play and tactical approaches to home and away matches may explain some of the variation in HA and AD between teams from different countries.}
